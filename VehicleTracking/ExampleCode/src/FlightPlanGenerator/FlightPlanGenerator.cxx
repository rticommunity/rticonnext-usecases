//
// The way that ATC works in the real world, a flight plan is registered 
// hours in advance of a flight, and it is sent to the appropriate interested
// applications.  It is updated if the plan needs to change for some reason.
// 
// This application creates a number of flight plans, based on the argument to
// the application.  It creates the flight plans for a variety of airlines, and
// sends them.  
//
// The flight plan data is modeled as RTI Connext DDS "state data," meaning:
//   1) the data is modeled to have a key field which differentiates individual
//      flight plans.  This key field is the flight ID.
//   ...and that it is sent:
//   1) Reliably
//   2) Durably - meaning that this application can write a flight plan, and
//      even if the subscribing applications do not exist, yet, they will be
//      notified of all flight plans as soon as they create the corresponding
//      DataReader.
//   3) With a history set to: kind = keep last, depth = 1.  This means that 
//      just the most recent update to each flight plan will be sent to 
//      DataReaders at startup.  
//      Note:  THIS HISTORY SETTING IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR STRICT RELIABLITY.
//      If you were to rapidly update the same flight plan many times, it is 
//      possible that some updates would be overwritten.  This guarantees 
//      delivery of the _most recent_ update to the flight plan.
