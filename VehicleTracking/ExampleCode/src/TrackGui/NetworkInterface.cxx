//    essentially all the objects that are (usually) created only once, 
//    regardless of how many data streams the application is sending or 
//    receiving.
//    The objects that are (usually) created once generally include:
//      1) DomainParticipant objects.  Typically an application has only one,
//         unless it must communicate in multiple domains.
//      2) Publisher and/or Subscriber.  Typically an application has at most 
//	       one of each.
//      3) Topics.  A topic with a particular name may be created only once per
//         DomainParticipant, and can be shared between multiple DataWriters
//         and DataReaders.
//      4) Types.  These must be registered and unregistered exactly once with
//         the DomainParticipant.
// 2) Any DataWriters and DataReaders that comprise the network interface
//    of the application.

// This example is using an application thread to be notified when tracks

// In this example, we leave the data from the middleware's queue by calling

// the flight information (flight plan + track) can be created from data
// that remains in the middleware's queue.  The middleware is configured 
// with QoS that allow old updates of track data to be overwritten, so the
// queue does not grow forever.
//
// There are three options for getting data from RTI Connext DDS:
// 1. Being notified in the application's thread of data arriving (as here).
//    This mechanism has slightly higher latency than option #2, but low
//    latency is not important for this use case.  In addition, this is safer
//    than using option #2, because you do not have to worry about the effect
//    on the middleware's thread.  
//    This uses WaitSet objects to be notified of data arriving.
//    A simple of example of this can be found at: 
//    http://community.rti.com/examples/waitset-status-condition
// 2. Being notified in a listener callback of data arriving.
//    This has lower latency than using a WaitSet, but is more dangerous
//    because you have to worry about not blocking the middleware's thread.
// 3. Polling for data.
//    You can call read() or take() at any time to view or remove the data that
//    is currently in the queue. 
//    A simple example of this can be found at:
//    http://community.rti.com/examples/polling-read
