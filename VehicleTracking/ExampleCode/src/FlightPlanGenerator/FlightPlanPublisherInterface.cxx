// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The FlightPlanPublisherInterface is the network interface to the whole 
// application.  This creates a DataWriter in order to send flight plan data
// over the network (or shared memory) to other applications that are 
// interested in flight plans.
//
// This interface is built from:
// 1. Network data types and topic names defined in the IDL file
// 2. XML configuration files that describe the QoS profiles that should be 
//    used by individual DataWriters and DataReaders.  These describe the 
//    movement and persistence characteristics of the data (how reliable should
//    this be?), as well as other QoS such as resource limits.
// 3. The code itself creates DataWriters, and selects which QoS profile to use
//    when creating the DataWriters.
// 
// Writing flight plan data:
// -------------------------
// This application sends flight plan data, configured to act as state data
// (or last-value cache).  This will reliably deliver the flight plan to both
// existing and late-joining applications that subscribe to flight plan data.
//
// For information on the flight plan data type, please see the 
// AirTrafficControl.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for flight plan state data, please
// see the flight_plan_profiles.xml file.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
