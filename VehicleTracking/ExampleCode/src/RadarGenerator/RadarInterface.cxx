// ------------------------------------------------------------------------- //
// The RadarInterface is the network interface to the whole application.  This 
// creates DataReaders and DataWriters in order to receive and send data.  
//
// This interface is built from:
// 1. Network data types and topic names defined in the IDL file
// 2. XML configuration files that describe the QoS profiles that should be 
//    used by individual DataWriters and DataReaders.  These describe the 
//    movement and persistence characteristics of the data (how reliable should
//    this be?), as well as other QoS such as resource limits.
// 3. The code itself creates DataReaders and DataWriters, and selects which 
//    profile to use when creating the DataReaders and DataWriters.
//
// Writing radar data:
// -------------------
// This application sends radar data, either with the lowest possible latency
// or with higher throughput at a slight cost in latency.
// 
// For information on the radar data type, please see the AirTrafficControl.idl
// file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for throughput vs. latency, please
// see the radar_profiles_multicast.xml file.
//
// Reading flight plan data:
// -------------------------
// This application receives flight plan data.  This data is sent less
// frequently, and if it was sent before the radar application was started, it
// must be automatically delivered to the radar at startup.  Becasue of these
// requirements, it has different QoS than the radar data.  This QoS is
// generally described as the QoS for "state data"
// 
// For information on the flight plan data type, please see the 
// AirTrafficControl.idl file.  
//
// For information on the quality of service for flight plan state data, please
// see the flight_plan_profiles.xml file.
